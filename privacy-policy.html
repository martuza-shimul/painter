                  We respect your rights to privacy and will respond to requests
                  for access or control over information about you in accordance
                  with Data Protection Law. We may require you to verify your
                  identity before we take any action. <br />
                  Depending on the reason we have your personal data, you have a
                  right to: <br />
                  access the personal information we hold about you (commonly
                  known as subject access); <br />
                  request that we correct or complete personal information we
                  hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete; <br />
                  request that we erase your personal information in some
                  circumstances, or object to our processing it as detailed at
                  paragraph 8.5; <br />
                  restrict how we use your personal information, in certain

                  request that we provide you with copies of your personal
                  information in a machine-readable format or transfer it across
                  different services; and where we have asked for your consent
                  to process your data, to withdraw this consent. <br />
                  These rights are limited in some situations under Data
                  Protection Law – for example, where we can demonstrate that we
                  are under a legal obligation to process your data. <br />
                  If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us

                <h3 class="title">Your right to object</h3>
                <p>
                  You have a right to object to our processing of your personal
                  data and ask us to stop doing so. If we are processing your
                  personal data or direct marketing purposes (which includes
                  profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
                  marketing) and you object to this, we will stop processing
                  your personal data immediately. <br />
                  If our processing of your personal data is in the public
                  interest or pursuant to our legitimate interests and you
                  object to this, we will stop processing your personal data
                  unless we have compelling reasons which override your
                  interests, or our use of your personal data is for the
                  establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. <br />
                  We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the
                  way we process your data. However, if you have unresolved
                  concerns you also have the right to complain to data
                  protection authorities (in the UK, the Information
                  Commissioner’s Office). You can call the ICO on 0303 123 1113

                <p>
                  Your personal data will only be kept for as long as necessary
                  for our purposes. Specific periods are set out in the table at

                <h3>DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES</h3>
                <p>
                  We process your personal data in accordance with the following
                  principles: we process your personal data lawfully, fairly and
                  in a transparent way; <br />
                  we collect your personal data for specified, explicit and
                  legitimate purposes; any further processing we do is
                  compatible with the original purposes for which for which we
                  collected it; <br />
                  we only process personal data which is adequate, relevant and
                  limited to what is necessary to achieve the purpose for which
                  it is processed; <br />
                  we take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal data is
                  accurate and kept up to date where necessary; <br />
                  we do not store personal data in a form which identifies you
                  for any longer than is necessary for the purposes of
                  processing; and <br />
                  we process personal data securely and in a way that protects
                  against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss,
                  destruction or damage. <br />
                  When we ask for your personal data we will tell you whether
                  you are required by law or contract to provide it, and what
                  will happen if you do not provide the data. <br />
                  Any request for consent to the processing of your personal
                  data will be made directly to you and will include information
                  about why we require the personal data and what will be done
                  with it.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title">WHAT IS OUR LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING?</h3>

                <p>
                  We will only process personal data when we have a lawful basis
                  for doing that processing. The table at the end of this notice
                  sets out the lawful basis we rely on for each type of data we
                  process. <br />
                  <strong>
                    We will choose one of the lawful bases in the GDPR to
                    justify how we use your personal data. These are:</strong
                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong> Consent:</strong> You have given consent to the
                  processing of your personal data for one or more specific
                  purposes. <br />
                  <strong> Contract:</strong> The processing is necessary for
                  the performance of a contract with you or in order to take
                  steps at your request before entering into a contract. <br />
                  <strong>Legal obligation:</strong> We need to process your
                  personal data to comply with a legal obligation. <br />
                  <strong>Vital interests:</strong> The processing is necessary
                  to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
                  <br />
                  <strong> Public interest:</strong> Processing is necessary for
                  the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
                  or in the exercise of some official authority. <br />
                  <strong> Legitimate interests:</strong> Processing is
                  necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by
                  us or someone else, except where such interests are overridden
                  by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring
                  the protection of your personal data.
